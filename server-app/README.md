# Example: Creating server with Finatra

Obs.: if you want to use Intellij you  need add sbt-idea plugin by adding in your project/plugins.sbt file this code:

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"

addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "1.7.0-SNAPSHOT")
```
